# CONTRIBUTING

So you're looking to contribute to Dify - that's awesome, we can't wait to see what you do. As a startup with limited headcount and funding, we have grand ambitions to design the most intuitive workflow for building and managing LLM applications. Any help from the community counts, truly.

We need to be nimble and ship fast given where we are, but we also want to make sure that contributors like you get as smooth an experience at contributing as possible. We've assembled this contribution guide for that purpose, aiming at getting you familiarized with the codebase & how we work with contributors, so you could quickly jump to the fun part.

This guide, like Dify itself, is a constant work in progress. We highly appreciate your understanding if at times it lags behind the actual project, and welcome any feedback for us to improve.

In terms of licensing, please take a minute to read our short [License and Contributor Agreement](./LICENSE). The community also adheres to the [code of conduct](https://github.com/langgenius/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
