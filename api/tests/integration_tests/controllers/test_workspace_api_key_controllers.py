Integration tests for workspace API key controllers.

These tests include HTTP request/response testing and controller integration.
They test the complete API endpoints with realistic scenarios.

Note: These tests were moved from unit_tests/ directory as they actually
test HTTP integration scenarios with external dependencies.

# - HTTP request/response cycles with real Flask app context
# - Authentication and authorization flows with real middleware
# - Request/response serialization with real JSON handling
# - Error responses and status codes with real HTTP context
# - API contract compliance with real endpoint testing
