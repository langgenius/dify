API WorkflowRun Repository Protocol

This module defines the protocol for service-layer WorkflowRun operations.
The repository provides an abstraction layer for WorkflowRun database operations
used by service classes, separating service-layer concerns from core domain logic.

Key Features:
- Paginated workflow run queries with filtering
- Bulk deletion operations with OSS backup support
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Expired record cleanup with data retention
- Service-layer specific query patterns

Usage:
    This protocol should be used by service classes that need to perform
    WorkflowRun database operations. It provides a clean interface that
    hides implementation details and supports dependency injection.

Example:
    ```python
    from repositories.dify_api_repository_factory import DifyAPIRepositoryFactory

    session_maker = sessionmaker(bind=db.engine, expire_on_commit=False)
    repo = DifyAPIRepositoryFactory.create_api_workflow_run_repository(session_maker)

    # Get paginated workflow runs
    runs = repo.get_paginated_workflow_runs(
        tenant_id="tenant-123",
        app_id="app-456",
        triggered_from=WorkflowRunTriggeredFrom.DEBUGGING,
        limit=20
    )
    ```
