"""
Service-layer repository protocol for WorkflowNodeExecutionModel operations.

This module provides a protocol interface for service-layer operations on WorkflowNodeExecutionModel
that abstracts database queries currently done directly in service classes. This repository is
specifically designed for service-layer needs and is separate from the core domain repository.

The service repository handles operations that require access to database-specific fields like
tenant_id, app_id, triggered_from, etc., which are not part of the core domain model.

    Protocol for service-layer operations on WorkflowNodeExecutionModel.

    This repository provides database access patterns specifically needed by service classes,
    handling queries that involve database-specific fields and multi-tenancy concerns.

    Key responsibilities:
    - Manages database operations for workflow node executions
    - Handles multi-tenant data isolation
    - Provides batch processing capabilities
    - Supports execution lifecycle management

    Implementation notes:
    - Returns database models directly (WorkflowNodeExecutionModel)
    - Handles tenant/app filtering automatically
    - Provides service-specific query patterns
    - Focuses on database operations without domain logic
    - Supports cleanup and maintenance operations
