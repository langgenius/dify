    Protocol for operations on WorkflowTriggerLog.

    This repository provides efficient access patterns for the trigger log table,

    - Batch operations for cleanup
    - Efficient queries with proper indexing
    - Pagination support
    - Status-based filtering

    - Leverage database indexes on (tenant_id, app_id), status, and created_at
    - Use batch operations for deletions to avoid locking
