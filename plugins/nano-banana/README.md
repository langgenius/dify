### Description

The **nano-banana** plugin is a lightweight "tool" plugin that serves as a minimal example of how to extend the host application with custom tooling. It is intended for experimentation, testing, and as a starting point for developing more feature-rich plugins.

In a typical setup, the host application discovers and loads nano-banana like any other tool-type plugin. Once enabled, it can be invoked through the host's standard plugin or tool execution mechanisms, allowing developers to verify that the plugin system is correctly configured without relying on complex business logic.
