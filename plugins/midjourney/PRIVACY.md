## Privacy

This document describes how the midjourney plugin handles your data.

### Scope

This privacy statement applies only to the midjourney plugin and to data
processed through its features. It does not cover any other plugins, tools,
or services you may use alongside it.

### Data We Collect

Depending on how you use the plugin, midjourney may process the following
categories of data:

- **Configuration data**: Settings and credentials you configure for the plugin.
- **Operational data**: Information necessary for the plugin to function,
  such as request payloads, responses, and error messages.

The plugin is not designed to intentionally collect directly identifying
personal information beyond what is required to call the Ace Data Cloud API.

### How We Use Data

We use data processed by the plugin solely to provide the plugin's features:
calling Ace Data Cloud Midjourney APIs and returning results back to Dify.

### Data Storage and Retention

The plugin does not persist your prompts, image URLs, or generated URLs
outside of the hosting environment. Any data sent to external services is
subject to their respective terms and retention practices.

### Data Sharing

We do not sell your data. Data is only transmitted to Ace Data Cloud endpoints
you invoke via this plugin.

### Security

You are responsible for protecting your credentials and securing your runtime
environment.
