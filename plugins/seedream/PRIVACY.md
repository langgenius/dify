## Privacy

This document describes how the seedream plugin handles your data.

### Scope

This privacy statement applies only to the seedream plugin and to data
processed through its features. It does not cover any other plugins, tools,
or services you may use alongside it.

### Data We Collect

Depending on how you use the plugin, seedream may process the following
categories of data:

- **Configuration data**: Settings and preferences you configure for the
  plugin (for example, enabling or disabling features, thresholds, or
  integration options).
- **Operational data**: Information necessary for the plugin to function,
  such as file paths, project identifiers, plugin state, and error messages.
- **Usage data (telemetry)**: Anonymous or aggregated metrics about which
  features are used and basic performance information, if telemetry is
  enabled in your host environment.

The plugin is not designed to intentionally collect directly identifying
personal information (such as your name, email address, or payment details)
beyond what is already handled by the platform or service hosting the
plugin. However, personal information could be present in the content of
files or project metadata you work with; such data is processed only to
provide the plugin's functionality.

### How We Use Data

We use data processed by the plugin solely for the following purposes:

- To provide and operate the plugin's core features.
- To maintain and improve reliability, performance, and security.
- To diagnose and fix bugs or issues you report.
- To understand, in aggregate, how features are used (if telemetry is
  enabled in your environment).

We do not use plugin data to build user profiles for advertising or
marketing.

### Data Storage and Retention

- **Local data**: Configuration and operational data are typically stored
  locally within your development environment, project, or host application.
  Retention is controlled by that environment (for example, by deleting or
  modifying configuration files or logs).
- **Remote services**: If the plugin is configured to communicate with
  external services or APIs, any data sent to those services is subject to
  their respective privacy policies and retention practices.
- **Diagnostic data**: If you choose to share logs or error reports with the
  maintainers (for example, via issue trackers), these may be retained for as
  long as needed to investigate and resolve the issue.

### Data Sharing

We do not sell your data.

We may share data only in the following limited circumstances:

- With service providers or infrastructure used to host issue trackers,
  crash reports, or similar tooling, and only to the extent necessary to
  operate those services.
- When required by law, regulation, or legal process, or to protect the
  rights, property, or safety of users or others.

Any third-party services you configure the plugin to interact with (for
example, source control platforms, CI/CD systems, or external APIs) will
process data under their own terms and privacy policies.

### Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to help protect
data processed by the plugin from unauthorized access, alteration, or
destruction. However, no software system or transmission method is entirely
secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

You are responsible for configuring and securing your own environment,
including access controls, network security, and backups.

### Your Choices and Rights

- You can configure or disable the plugin through your host environment's
  extension or plugin management features.
- You can edit or remove configuration files used by the plugin.
- You may choose not to enable integrations with any optional third-party
  services.

If you believe the plugin is handling data in a way that is inconsistent
with this policy, you should discontinue use of the plugin and contact the
maintainers.

### Contact

If you have questions about this privacy information, or if you wish to
raise a privacy-related concern, please contact the maintainers of the
seedream plugin through the official project repository or distribution
channel where you obtained this plugin.
