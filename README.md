Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Its intuitive interface combines agentic AI workflow, RAG pipeline, agent capabilities, model management, observability features and more, letting you quickly go from prototype to production. 

## Quick start
> Before installing Dify, make sure your machine meets the following minimum system requirements:
