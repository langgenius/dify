 * @name getOverlappingDaysInIntervals
 * @category Interval Helpers
 * @summary Get the number of days that overlap in two time intervals
 *
 * @description
 * Get the number of days that overlap in two time intervals. It uses the time
 * between dates to calculate the number of days, rounding it up to include
 * partial days.
 *
 * Two equal 0-length intervals will result in 0. Two equal 1ms intervals will
 * result in 1.
 *
 * @param intervalLeft - The first interval to compare.
 * @param intervalRight - The second interval to compare.
 * @param options - An object with options
 *
 * @returns The number of days that overlap in two time intervals
 *
 * @example
 * // For overlapping time intervals adds 1 for each started overlapping day:
 * getOverlappingDaysInIntervals(
 *   { start: new Date(2014, 0, 10), end: new Date(2014, 0, 20) },
 *   { start: new Date(2014, 0, 17), end: new Date(2014, 0, 21) }
 * )
 * //=> 3
 *
 * @example
 * // For non-overlapping time intervals returns 0:
 * getOverlappingDaysInIntervals(
 *   { start: new Date(2014, 0, 10), end: new Date(2014, 0, 20) },
 *   { start: new Date(2014, 0, 21), end: new Date(2014, 0, 22) }
 * )
 * //=> 0
