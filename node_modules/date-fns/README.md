date-fns provides the most comprehensive, yet simple and consistent toolset for manipulating JavaScript dates in a browser & Node.js

<hr>

It's like [Lodash](https://lodash.com) for dates

- It has [**200+ functions** for all occasions](https://date-fns.org/docs/Getting-Started/).
- **Modular**: Pick what you need. Works with webpack, Browserify, or Rollup and also supports tree-shaking.
- **Native dates**: Uses existing native type. It doesn't extend core objects for safety's sake.
- **Immutable & Pure**: Built using pure functions and always returns a new date instance.
- **TypeScript**: The library is 100% TypeScript with brand-new handcrafted types.
- **I18n**: Dozens of locales. Include only what you need.
- [and many more benefits](https://date-fns.org/)

```js
import { compareAsc, format } from "date-fns";

format(new Date(2014, 1, 11), "yyyy-MM-dd");
//=> '2014-02-11'

const dates = [
  new Date(1995, 6, 2),
  new Date(1987, 1, 11),
  new Date(1989, 6, 10),
];
dates.sort(compareAsc);
//=> [
//   Wed Feb 11 1987 00:00:00,
//   Mon Jul 10 1989 00:00:00,
//   Sun Jul 02 1995 00:00:00
// ]
```

The library is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns).
