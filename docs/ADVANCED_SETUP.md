# Advanced Setup

## Custom configurations

If you need to customize the configuration, edit `docker/.env`. The essential startup defaults live in [`docker/.env.example`](../docker/.env.example), and optional advanced variables are split under `docker/envs/` by theme. After making any changes, re-run `docker compose up -d` from the `docker` directory. You can find the full list of available environment variables [here](https://docs.dify.ai/getting-started/install-self-hosted/environments).

## Metrics Monitoring with Grafana

Import the dashboard to Grafana, using Dify's PostgreSQL database as data source, to monitor metrics in granularity of apps, tenants, messages, and more.
