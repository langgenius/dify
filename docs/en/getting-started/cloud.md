Dify offers a [cloud service](http://cloud.dify.ai) for everyone, so you can use the full functionality of LangGenius without deploying it yourself. To use the cloud version of LangGenius, you need to have a GitHub or Google account.

1. Log in to [Dify Cloud](https://cloud.dify.ai) and create a new Workspace or join an existing one
2. Configure your model provider or use our hosted model provider
3. You can [create an application](../application/creating-an-application.md) now!

Currently, we don't have a pricing plan. If you like this LLMOps product, please introduce it to your friends😄.
