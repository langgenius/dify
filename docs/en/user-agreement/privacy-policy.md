We may share your personal information with your consent. We may also share any category of personal information described above:

* Sharing with our business partners and other third-party service providers. We share information with third parties who help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support, and market our services.

We work with third-party service providers who provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analytics, and other services to us. Such services may require the service provider to access or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access information about you to act on our behalf in performing services, they will do so under our close instruction and adopt appropriate security and confidentiality procedures to protect your information.
* Sharing with potential buyers and advisors. If there is a company sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, similar event, or measures taken in anticipation of such an event (such as due diligence in a transaction), your personal information may (in accordance with applicable law) be shared with our advisors and any potential buyer's advisors and be transferred to the new owner of the business.

### How we store and secure information we collect?

Storage and Processing. The information collected through our website and our products may be stored and processed in any country/region where LangGenius or its affiliated companies or service providers maintain facilities, including your region, the United States, Australia, Canada, China, and the European Economic Area (including the United Kingdom). Our choice of processing location is to ensure efficient operations, improve performance, and create redundancy to protect data in the event of disruptions or other issues. We take measures to ensure that the data we collect in accordance with this Privacy Policy is processed in compliance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws, regardless of where the data is located.

International Data Transfers. When we transfer personal information from the European Economic Area (including the UK) and Switzerland to the United States or other countries/regions where the European Commission has not determined their laws provide adequate data protection, we use legal mechanisms designed to help ensure your rights and protections, including contracts. Specifically, our website servers are located in the United States, and our affiliates, partners, third parties, and service providers operate in the United States, European Economic Area, and China. This means that when we collect your personal information, we may process it in any of these countries. However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information is protected in accordance with this privacy policy. The main safeguard relied upon by LangGenius is the Standard Contractual Clauses for Data Protection approved by the European Commission. For more information about these mechanisms, please contact us using the detailed contact information provided in the "How to Contact Us" section below.

Keeping your information safe. LangGenius cares about the security of your information and takes reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction of personal information. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems or your information.

Lawful basis for processing personal information (EEA only). LangGenius , is the data controller of your information.

This section below is specifically for you if you are located in the European EconomicArea (EEA), United Kingdom or Switzerland.

Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will indicate this at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences, if any, if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), we will indicate to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you have questions about the legal basis for processing or want to find out more, please contact us using the details at the end of this Privacy Policy.

Retention. We retain personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes for which the personal information is processed and for longer periods as necessary for us to comply with applicable laws. For example, we retain your account information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with Products you have requested or authorized, including maintaining and improving the performance of the Products and protecting system security. We also retain personal data as needed to maintain appropriate business and financial records, protect our legal interests, resolve disputes, or comply with legal or regulatory requirements. Thereafter, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will store your personal information using appropriate security measures and take appropriate steps designed to isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

### How to access and control your information?

You have certain rights regarding your personal information, subject to the applicable laws. These include the following rights to:

* Access your personal information: You have the right to ask us to confirm whether we are processing your personal information, and, where that is the case, access to the personal information and receive information on how your data is processed as well as ask us to provide a copy of your personal information.
* Rectify your personal information: You have the right to have any incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected.
* Erase your personal information: You have the right to ask us to delete your personal information when, for example, the data we hold on you is no longer needed or when your data has been processed unlawfully.
* Object to processing: You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information and request us to cease processing of it if, for example, this data is being processed for the purpose of direct marketing or where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party). Under certain circumstances, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
* Restrict the processing: You have the right to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the accuracy of the personal information; (b) if our use of the data is illegal but you do not want it erased; (c) if you require us to hold the data even if we no longer need it as you require it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) if you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
* Receive your personal information in a usable electronic format and transmit it to a third party (right to data portability): If we are processing your personal information based on your consent or a contract, you can ask to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. Without any obstacle from us, you can also ask us to transmit those data to another controller.
* Withdraw consent: Where we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we will no longer process that personal information, but we may be unable to continue providing certain products or services to you for which the personal information was sought. At the time you withdraw your consent, we will advise you if this is the case.
* Opt-out of communications: By using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your Service account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database, you may opt-out of receiving promotional communications from us. You will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services even after you opt-out from receiving promotional messages from us. You can opt-out of some notification messages in your account settings. Please note, you will continue to receive generic ads.
* Send "Do Not Track" Signals: Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Our Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals since there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal. You can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt-out of receiving marketing from us as described above.

These rights may be limited in some situations – for example, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your data (such as where tax authorities require us to retain it) or where it is needed for the proper performance of a contract. Under certain circumstances, this may mean that we are able to retain data even if you withdraw your consent.

If an administrator manages the service for you (see "Notice to End Users" below), you may need to contact your administrator first to assist with your requests. For all other requests, please contact us through the details in the "How to Contact Us" section below. If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.

If you are a California resident, please kindly refer to the "California Requirements" below for your rights and other important information.
