# Conversation Application

Conversational applications use a question-and-answer model to maintain a dialogue with the user. Conversational applications support the following capabilities (please confirm that the following functions are enabled when the application is programmed):

* Variables to fill in before the dialog. Create, pin, and delete conversations.
* Conversation remarks.
* Follow-up.
* Speech to text.

### Variables filled in before the dialog

If you have the requirement to fill in variables when you apply the layout, you need to fill in the information according to the prompts before entering the dialog window:
