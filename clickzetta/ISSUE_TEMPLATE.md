## ðŸš€ Feature Request: Add Clickzetta Lakehouse as Vector Database Option

### **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently, Dify supports several vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, etc.) but lacks support for Clickzetta Lakehouse. This creates a gap for customers who are already using Clickzetta Lakehouse as their data platform and want to integrate it with Dify for RAG applications.

### **Describe the solution you'd like**
Add Clickzetta Lakehouse as a vector database option in Dify, allowing users to configure Clickzetta as their vector storage backend through standard Dify configuration.

### **Business Justification**
- **Customer Demand**: Real commercial customers are actively waiting for Dify + Clickzetta integration solution for trial validation
- **Unified Data Platform**: Clickzetta Lakehouse provides a unified platform for both vector data and structured data storage
- **Performance**: Supports HNSW vector indexing and high-performance similarity search
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces the need for separate vector database infrastructure

### **Describe alternatives you've considered**
- **External Vector Database**: Using separate vector databases like Pinecone or Weaviate, but this adds infrastructure complexity and cost
- **Data Duplication**: Maintaining data in both Clickzetta and external vector databases, leading to synchronization challenges
- **Custom Integration**: Building custom connectors, but this lacks the seamless integration that native Dify support provides

### **Proposed Implementation**
Implement Clickzetta Lakehouse integration following Dify's existing vector database pattern:

#### **Core Components**:
- `ClickzettaVector` class implementing `BaseVector` interface
- `ClickzettaVectorFactory` for instance creation  
- Configuration through Dify's standard config system

#### **Key Features**:
- âœ… Vector similarity search with HNSW indexing
- âœ… Full-text search with inverted indexes
- âœ… Concurrent write operations with queue mechanism
- âœ… Chinese text analysis support
- âœ… Automatic index management

#### **Configuration Example**:
```bash
VECTOR_STORE=clickzetta
CLICKZETTA_USERNAME=your_username
CLICKZETTA_PASSWORD=your_password
CLICKZETTA_INSTANCE=your_instance
CLICKZETTA_SERVICE=api.clickzetta.com
CLICKZETTA_WORKSPACE=your_workspace
CLICKZETTA_VCLUSTER=default_ap
CLICKZETTA_SCHEMA=dify
```

### **Technical Specifications**
- **Vector Operations**: Insert, search, delete vectors with metadata
- **Indexing**: Automatic HNSW vector index creation with configurable parameters
- **Concurrency**: Write queue mechanism for thread safety
- **Distance Metrics**: Support for cosine distance and L2 distance
- **Full-text Search**: Inverted index for content search with Chinese text analysis
- **Scalability**: Handles large-scale vector data with efficient batch operations

### **Implementation Status**
- âœ… Implementation is complete and ready for integration
- âœ… Comprehensive testing completed in real Clickzetta environments
- âœ… 100% test pass rate for core functionality
- âœ… Performance validated with production-like data volumes
- âœ… Backward compatibility verified with existing Dify configurations
- âœ… Full documentation provided
- âœ… PR submitted: #22551

### **Testing Evidence**
```
ðŸ§ª Standalone Tests: 3/3 passed (100%)
ðŸ§ª Integration Tests: 8/8 passed (100%)
ðŸ§ª Performance Tests: Vector search ~170ms, Insert rate ~5.3 docs/sec
ðŸ§ª Real Environment: Validated with actual Clickzetta Lakehouse instance
```

### **Business Impact**
- **Customer Enablement**: Enables customers already using Clickzetta to adopt Dify seamlessly
- **Infrastructure Simplification**: Reduces complexity by using unified data platform
- **Enterprise Ready**: Supports enterprise-grade deployments with proven stability
- **Cost Optimization**: Eliminates need for separate vector database infrastructure

### **Additional Context**
This feature request is backed by direct customer demand and includes a complete, tested implementation ready for integration. The implementation follows Dify's existing patterns and maintains full backward compatibility.
