// Package snapshot implements single-pass streaming save/restore of the
// runtime's Home directory as tar+zstd archives.
//
// SIZE CONTRACT: this package imposes NO size limits. Consumers own size
// policy and must bound the streams they read or send in their own logic —
// count bytes while reading a save stream and abort at their cap; bound what
// they send to restore. In Dify EE the sandbox-gateway enforces this.
