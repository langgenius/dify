## Frontend Workflow

- Refer to the `./docs/test.md`, `./docs/lint.md`, and `./docs/type-check.md` for detailed frontend workflow instructions.

## Automated Test Generation

- Use `./docs/test.md` as the canonical instruction set for generating frontend automated tests.
- When proposing or saving tests, re-read that document and follow every requirement.
- All frontend tests MUST also comply with the `frontend-testing` skill. Treat the skill as a mandatory constraint, not optional guidance.
