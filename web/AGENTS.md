## Automated Test Generation

- Use `web/testing/testing.md` as the canonical instruction set for generating frontend automated tests.
- When proposing or saving tests, re-read that document and follow every requirement.
- All frontend tests MUST also comply with the `frontend-testing` skill. Treat the skill as a mandatory constraint, not optional guidance.
