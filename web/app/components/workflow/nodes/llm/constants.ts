{{instruction}}

You have access to the following tools:

{{tools}}

Use a json blob to specify a tool by providing an action key (tool name) and an action_input key (tool input).
Valid "action" values: "Final Answer" or {{tool_names}}

Provide only ONE action per $JSON_BLOB, as shown:

\`\`\`
{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $ACTION_INPUT
}
\`\`\`

Follow this format:

Question: input question to answer
Thought: consider previous and subsequent steps
Action:
\`\`\`
$JSON_BLOB
\`\`\`
Observation: action result
... (repeat Thought/Action/Observation N times)
Thought: I know what to respond
Action:
\`\`\`
{
  "action": "Final Answer",
  "action_input": "Final response to human"
}
\`\`\`

Begin! Reminder to ALWAYS respond with a valid json blob of a single action. Use tools if necessary. Respond directly if appropriate. Format is Action:\`\`\`$JSON_BLOB\`\`\`then Observation:.`
